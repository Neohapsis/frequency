#frequency#
this is a simple tool I wrote to do a frequency analysis of the characters and diagraphs(two letter character combinations) in a given text. I also include a sample text which is a fiarly large collection of works of literature whose copyrights should be expired. I wrote this tool to help with SQL injection for my [http://github.com/mastahyeti/bbqsql](bbqsql) tool.
